               <s> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of </s>the printing and typesetting industry. 
                Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
                when an unknown printer took a galley of <del> and scrambled it to make a type specimen 
                book. It has survived not only five centuries,</del>d but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
                remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
                sheets containing Lorem <u> passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like
                Aldus PageMaker including </u>versions of Lorem Ipsum
            </p>
        

            <p class="lead">
               <mark> It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the
                readable content of a page when </mark>looking at its layout. The point of using 
                Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution <em> of letters, as opposed</em>
                to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop 
                publishing packages and web page <b>editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their </b>default model text, and a 
                search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites <small> in their infancy. Various versions have
                evolved </small>over the years, sometimes by 
                accident, <strong> on purpose (injected humour and the like)</strong>.
